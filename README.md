I’m a 17 year old college student currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science
My interests lie in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bioinformatics, particularly where data-driven technologies can contribute to solving problems in healthcare and science.
I’ve started building my foundation in Python and exploring how AI can be applied in real-world contexts through hands-on workshops and guided projects.
I'm always enthusiastic to continue learning through coursework, certifications, and project-based exploration, and I look forward to growing within communities that value innovation, curiosity, and collaboration.
If you’re into tech, data, or just figuring it all out like me, feel free to connect. Always happy to learn from new people and share what I know.
